Hi! My name is Victoria, I am a MSc student at McMaster University in Canada. I am studying the effects of wastewater treatment effluent on Rainbow Darter fish gut-content microbiome. 
I will be using bioinformatics to analyze fish gut-content micro biome between upstream and downstream sites, with the hypothesis that micro biome diversity will decrease downstream of wastewater treatment plants.
